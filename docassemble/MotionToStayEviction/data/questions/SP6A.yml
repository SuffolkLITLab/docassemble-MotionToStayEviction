question: |
  Motion to Stay Eviction
subquestion: |
  In civil cases, an application for a stay of the judgment or order of a lower court pending appeal, or for approval of a bond under Rule 6 (a)(2), or for an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction during the pendency of an appeal must ordinarily be made in the first instance in the lower court. 
  
  A motion for such relief may be made to the appellate court or to a single justice, but the motion shall show that application to the lower court for the relief sought is not practicable, or that the lower court has denied an application, or has failed to afford the relief which the applicant requested, with the reasons given by the lower court for its action. 
  
  The motion shall also show the reasons for the relief requested and the facts relied upon, and if the facts are subject to dispute, the motion shall be supported by affidavits or other statements signed under the penalties of perjury or copies thereof. 
  
  With the motion shall be filed such parts of the record as are relevant. 
  
  Reasonable notice of the motion shall be given to all parties. 
  
  The motion shall be filed with the clerk of the appellate court to which the appeal is being taken. 
  
  If the court is the Supreme Judicial Court, the motion shall be filed with the clerk of the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County.
