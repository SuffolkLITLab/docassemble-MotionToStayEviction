    We need to know if you are the "Plaintiff" or the "Defendant" in your
    trial court case.

    If you are the first person to file a form in the case, you are the
    "Plaintiff" or the "Petitioner."

    If you are responding to a case or court papers someone else filed, you are
    the "Defendant" or the "Respondent."
